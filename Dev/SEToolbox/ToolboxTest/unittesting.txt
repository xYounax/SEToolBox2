For testing, remember to:
1. Set the Configuration to x64.
2. Set the test settings file to "TestSettings1.runsettings", which is in the Solution folder.
3. Set the test processor architecture to x64.

Currently tests are running using "vstest.executionengine.exe", which runs from the build folder of the test project.
